		<p style="color: aliceblue">Games, we all know them and most of us love them.  Being born in the modern area, I was always surrounded by games.  Most of my free time has been spent watching or playing games, and therefore they had a large effect on me.  Through a lifetime of exposure, I became more and more invested in games.  I used this passion for games and turned it into a motivating factor for me to do other things as well.  Games are a great motivator for me, as they are the most enjoyable part of my life.  They push me to learn and create things that I normally wouldn’t without them.  Games help me become more invested in GAME.</p>
		<p style="color: aliceblue">Games can motivate me in many different ways and many different games motivate me.  Minecraft is one of the biggest games ever and resulted in my biggest project.  There is a regular Minecraft event held most months called MCC.  I have watched many MCCs by now and it is a common thing in the community to predict the outcome of the event.  I myself want to join in on this, so I spent many hours building a google sheet to help me do this based on the in-game scoring system and player statistics.  Up to this day I still update it when needed.  This endeavor not only produced my original goal but helped me improve in other ways.  The knowledge and practice I gained from using formulas and functions helped me in my Excel class.Games and GAME are probably the two most influential things in my life, it is just a coincidence that they are so similar. </p>
		<p style="color: aliceblue">GAME stands up geography, academics, meteorology, and environmentalism. These topics are the things that guide and determine my future, from where I go to what I become. I value all of these topics and invested a lot of time and effort into them. I memorized every countries’ name, location, and relative population. I studied and worked hard for straight As’. I know the basics of cyclogenesis. I learned to deeply care for the environment.</p></th>
